	<p>Struck by the sudden rise in suicides amongst LGBT youth in 2010, Rainbow Chronicle co-founders Travis Lowry and Conor Clary were inspired to find a way to help at-risk individuals. Rainbow Chronicle is a unique online destination that allows users to identify business establishments, community leaders, and organizations that are supportive and accepting of LGBT and allied communities, while calling attention to those that are perceived as bigoted and homophobic. </p>
	<h3>About</h3>
	<p>Rainbow Chronicle is the only online community that allows users to rate businesses, events, organizations and individuals according to their perceived LGBT friendliness. Whether a sandwich shop, dive bar or hotel, elementary school, or even a local politician or celebrity, users post ratings and reviews in their own words and grade each entity based on its acceptance of the LGBT community and consumer. Rainbow Chronicle seeks to support all members of the LGBT and allied communities, serving as a user-generated listening post to promote accepting establishments and personalities while calling attention to the actions and practices of those who perpetuate bigotry. </p>
	<h3>Mission</h3>
	Rainbow Chronicle seeks to call to attention the actions and practices of businesses, organizations and community leaders through user-generated reviews in an effort to identify those that are LGBT-friendly and those that are not. No longer can individuals, corporations and small businesses act in a bigoted manner with impunity. For the first time, there is a single resource for unequivocally determining who is and who is not trusted and supportive of the LGBT and allied communities.
	<h3>Site Features</h3>
	<p><strong>News:</strong> Offers users breaking news relevant to LGBT communities. Users participate in generating this news feed through posts, “shares,” and comments, and are also able to customize their personal feeds by geographic area, popularity and relevancy.
	<br>
	<p><strong>Places:</strong> Allows users to view and post personal reviews and listings of local businesses based on their perceived LGBT friendliness. Ratings are on a scale of <strong>-5</strong> (poor) to <strong>+5</strong> (excellent) based on variables including <span style="font-style: italic;">Overall LGBT Friendliness, Good for Same-Sex Couples, Good for Large LGBT Groups, Attitude of Customers,</span> etc. 
	<p>Beyond traditional restaurant, bar or store reviews, users can rate organizations or corporations. Criteria for these reviews include such fields as <span style="font-style: italic;">Same-Sex Partner/Spousal Benefits, Diversity Initiatives,</span> etc. 
	<p><strong>Leaders: </strong>Using the same rating and reviews format as applies to ‘Places,’ Rainbow Chronicle users can post reviews of individuals and local leaders based on their perceived LGBT friendliness, including religious leaders, local politicians, law enforcement, educators, sports coaches or news anchors. 
	<p><strong>Events: </strong>Rainbow Chronicle represents a unified source for postings of all LGBT related events. Events are searchable by category, geographic location and date. Users can post all events pertinent to the LGBT community, not just those that are positive or supportive, ranging from a Gay Pride parade or job fair targeting LGBT students, to a protest by a conservative church.
